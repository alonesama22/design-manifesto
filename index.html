    <h1>Happiness isn’t something you “obtain”.</h1>
    <p>The sooner you realize that happiness is not something you obtain like a piece of furniture or a job, the more likely you are to achieve it.</p>
    <p>Most people think they will be happy if they get a promotion, make a sale, start a relationship with someone, or buy a certain kind of car.</p>
    <p>But happiness is <span>created</span>, not acquired.</p>
    <p>Have you ever wondered why – as a general rule – people with less are happier than people with more?</p>
